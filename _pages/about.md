My lifelong fascination with AI and specifically with data has led me to pursue a career in data science, and I am motivated by the opportunity to contribute my expertise to a strong and forward-looking organization like yours. With a PhD in Artificial Intelligence from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and extensive postdoctoral experience in applying machine learning, data integration, and advanced analytics, I bring a strong foundation in research and a proven ability to translate complex data challenges into practical solutions.

Throughout my career, I have worked at the intersection of data science, engineering, and applied research. My doctoral work involved developing a personalized digital health application that combined adaptive mathematical models, machine learning algorithms, and real-time sensor data to deliver tailored interventions. This required building robust, reproducible data pipelines in Python and R, designing user-friendly interfaces, and bridging theoretical models with real-world implementation.
